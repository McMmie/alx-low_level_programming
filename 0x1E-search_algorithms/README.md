Search Algorithms in C
This repository provides implementations of various search algorithms in the C programming language. These algorithms are essential for efficiently finding elements in a collection, such as an array or a linked list. Understanding and implementing these algorithms can be valuable for improving the efficiency of your code.

Algorithms Included
Linear Search

File: linear_search
Description: Simple search algorithm that sequentially checks each element in a list until a match is found or the entire list has been searched.
Binary Search

File: binary_search
Description: Efficient search algorithm for sorted lists. It repeatedly divides the search range in half.
Depth-First Search (DFS)

File: depth_first_search
Description: Graph traversal algorithm that explores as far as possible along each branch before backtracking.
Breadth-First Search (BFS)

File: breadth_first_search
Description: Graph traversal algorithm that explores all the vertices at the current depth prior to moving on to the vertices at the next depth level.
